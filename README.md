## Selection Sort

This is a simple algorithm for sorting vectors using the Selection Sort sorting method.

The programming language used in this algorithm will be java.

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly searches remaining items to find the smallest element and moves it to the correct location.

In comparison to Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort (both methods are covered in two repositories in my profile), the Selection Sort method has an average performance. It performs better than Bubble Sort, but is less efficient than Insertion Sort.
